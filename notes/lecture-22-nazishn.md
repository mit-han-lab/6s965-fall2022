## Section1:NISQ Devices
Today we are in a Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum(NISQ) era. This is because 
1. the qubits are very sensitive to the environment and quantum gates are very unreliable. 
2. We have limited number of qbits available.
3. Does not have all-to-all conections.
4. There is a large gap between the algorithm and devices available. For a meaningful algorithm the number of qubits required increases by a lot number. The following plot shows the number of physical qbits and the error tolerance of an algorithm.
